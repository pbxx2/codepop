# CodePop 2026 Requirements

## Introduction

### Overview of CodePop

CodePop is an AI-driven custom soda ordering and fulfillment platform designed to automate the process of creating, ordering, and picking up custom sodas and floats. The system combines mobile and web-based user interfaces with backend automation and AI-assisted decision-making to minimize human involvement while maintaining efficiency, consistency, and a high-quality user experience. CodePop allows users to customize drinks manually, receive AI-generated drink suggestions, or select from preset menus, while handling ordering, scheduling, and inventory management through automated systems.

The platform supports multiple user roles with different permissions and responsibilities, including general users, account users, managers, and administrators. Customers can place orders using either geolocation-based timing or manually selected pickup times to ensure drinks are prepared as close to arrival as possible. From an operational perspective, CodePop is designed to reduce staffing requirements by automating inventory tracking, order timing, and system monitoring, enabling a small number of managers to oversee store operations remotely.

This Spring 2026 project expands CodePop beyond its original scope. The system must now support multiple store locations nationwide, operate without a centralized server, and include advanced logistics and maintenance coordination. These changes introduce new architectural, organizational, and data-management challenges while preserving the core goals of automation, scalability, and usability that define CodePop.

### Purpose of Requirements Document

The purpose of this requirements document is to define and prioritize the functional and non-functional requirements for the extended CodePop system. This document serves as a shared reference for the development team and stakeholders by clearly describing what the system is expected to do, how responsibilities are divided among user roles, and which features are required, optional, or explicitly out of scope.

This document is intended to:

- Establish a clear understanding of new system requirements, including multi-store support, decentralized communication, supply hubs, and machine maintenance tracking.
- Define new user roles and permissions, such as logistics managers, repair staff, and super admins.
- Clarify updated responsibilities and access limits for existing roles.
- Provide a structured approach to requirement prioritization using MoSCoW analysis.
- Ensure continuity with the original CodePop requirements while allowing flexibility in system design and implementation.

This document does not mandate a specific implementation, architecture, programming language, or database technology. Teams are free to redesign or refactor the system as needed, provided all required constraints and deliverables outlined by the project are met.

---

### Introduction to MoSCoW Analysis

To manage scope and prioritize development effort, this project uses **MoSCoW analysis** as the requirements prioritization method. MoSCoW analysis categorizes requirements based on their importance to system functionality and project success.

The four MoSCoW categories are defined as follows:

- **Must Have (M):**  
  Requirements that are essential for the system to function and meet core project objectives. The system is considered incomplete if any Must Have requirements are not satisfied.

- **Should Have (S):**  
  High-priority requirements that significantly improve usability, performance, or maintainability but are not strictly required for minimal system operation.

- **Could Have (C):**  
  Desirable features that add value to the system but are not critical. These are typically implemented if time and resources allow.

- **Won’t Have (W):**  
  Features that are explicitly excluded from the current project scope and will not be implemented during this development cycle.

Each requirement in this document is labeled with its MoSCoW priority to ensure clarity and consistency across the development team.

## Summary of Previous Requirements

### Previous Requirements Overview

The original CodePop requirements defined a system focused on a single automated store with centralized management and minimal human involvement. The primary functional goals included allowing users to customize and order drinks through a mobile-first interface, supporting AI-generated drink recommendations, and automating operational tasks such as inventory tracking and order scheduling.

Key areas of functionality included:
